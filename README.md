### Hi there my name is Nathalie 👋💕

I am interested in **all** sciences, especially _Computer Science_.

My favorite hobby is painting, drawing, and singing to help me relax. 🎶

I come from Honduras and I love my country very much. 💖

In the past I have worked with the Global Youth Institute on the World Food Prize to impulse sustainable development. 👌
